# 🧠 BH Tour Assistant – Smart Tourism Chatbot

Explore the city of **Belo Horizonte** in an interactive and intelligent way!

The **BH Tour Assistant** is a chatbot designed to provide real-time suggestions of tourist attractions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **WebSocket** communication. The system interprets user queries and responds instantly, creating an immersive digital tourism experience.

## 📡 Project Overview

This project integrates **Natural** (NLP library) and **WebSocket** to enable:

- Instant responses to user questions.
- Smart suggestions for tourist spots based on keywords and patterns.
- A smooth and dynamic communication without the need to reload the page.

## 💬 Natural & NLP

**Natural** processes and links user questions to predefined tourist categories. A custom dataset was created with various question formats to train the model and help NLP detect recurring patterns.

### Example:
```
📌 "Which museums in BH offer free entry?" 
→ 🔑 Category Detected: "museu_lista_gratuitos"
```

This makes the chatbot more flexible and intelligent, adapting to different ways users ask similar things.
